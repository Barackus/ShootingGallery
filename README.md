# ShootingGallery
 
This is a VR shooting gallery program designed to test three different aiming methods. It reads an input file, spawns targets one by one, and writes the results to a text file. The input file is generated by TargetGenerator, a separate C++ program.

The program is made primarily in blueprint, with the exception of the reading and writing of text files, which is done in C++ and then extended to blueprint.

The program has three main classes:
Player handles the inputs and the aiming methods. It determines if a shot is a hit or miss, and passes this data along to the current target.
Target always faces the player, and moves in a random circle-strafe around the player if the target had a "dynamic" label, or remains stationary if it has a "static" label. It recieves shot data from player, passes this data along and destroys itself when it is shot three times.
TargetSpawner reads the input and determines when it is time to spawn a new target. It also passes along data generated from the user shooting targets, and writes these results with a new line for each target. After one aiming method is done, it tells the user to remove the headset to fill in a questionnaire, while the program switches aiming methods, and sets up a new set of targets.
